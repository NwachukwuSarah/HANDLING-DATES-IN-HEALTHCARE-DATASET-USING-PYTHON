PROJECT DESCRIPTION:

If you leave your date in object format python will not be able to recognize it as a date. But when you convert it to datetime, python then recognizes it as date. So you can handle your dates better that way. This project showcases how to convert dates to datetime in  python.

The columns to be converted are the “Date of Admission” and “Discharge of Date”, columns.
